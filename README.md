# README

Welcome! This is my movie entertainment app! I wanted to make an app that I can find useful to myself. This would be something that is related to an activity I enjoy. The activity I chose is watching movies. I never liked how each streaming service is limited to a specific quanity of movies on the platform. On top of that, movies and shows are temporary so if a movie is on your watchlist it wont be on the streaming service forever. So, I made a website that allowed users to add any movie to the homepage and favoring it to a watchlist. Each movie also displays the starring actors/actresses with an api request. This repo displays the backend portion of the app. The language and framework is Ruby on Rails. It shows the functionality of the app through controller actions, models, and associations. This was my first fullstack app and it showed how much I have grown as a Web Developer. I hope you enjoy!
